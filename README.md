# luckZone

luckzone is a simple game of luck wherby your 
major duty is to move a set of soldiers which
have been programmed to move randomly in a canvas
on click of corresponding buttons for each soldier 
to a red zone at the middle of the canvas. The soldiers
move with a generated random number hence what really
then makes it a game of luck.

**how to play**
On play, your timer starts. Successfully move each of the 
soldiers into the colored box in the middle of the canvas 
by clicking repeatedly the corresponding button for each 
Soldier. When any of the soldiers is in position, your 
button will be locked. Once all the soldiers are in position,
click any of the buttons one more time to get result.
